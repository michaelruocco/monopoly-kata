# Monopoly Kata

This project is my attempt at the monopoly kata exercise that is outlined here:

I have chosen to use cucumber as my BDD tool to translate the stated acceptance criteria into an executable

tried to keep the code as clean and simple as possible. Feedback and comments are very welcome!
